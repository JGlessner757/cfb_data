# College Football Data Analysis 🏈📊

Welcome to the ultimate college football data repository! This project dives into the numbers behind college football using the [CollegeFootballData API](https://api.collegefootballdata.com/), with a focus on exploring trends, team stats, and historical insights. While our initial analysis showcases team wins since 2013, we’re just getting started—this repo is built to grow with tons of analytical possibilities in store. Whether you’re a die-hard fan of a storied team or nostalgic about the now-dissolved PAC-12, we’ve got something for you!

## 💜 Go Dawgs and PAC-12 Legends

As a dedicated fan of the Washington Huskies, this project pays homage to the PAC-12 conference, home of countless rivalries, unforgettable games, and iconic moments. While the PAC-12’s legacy lives on in our memories, the data will continue to keep its story alive here through analysis, visualizations, and insights. Expect to see some focused looks at PAC-12 teams and moments that defined West Coast football.
